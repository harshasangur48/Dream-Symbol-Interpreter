# Dream-Symbol-Interpreter
Dream Symbol Interpreter is an AI-powered web app that interprets your dreams using machine learning and language models. Built with Streamlit, XGBoost, and Mistral AI, this project analyzes dream descriptions, identifies symbolic elements, and delivers a 3-paragraph interpretation in your chosen tone â€” Mystical, Poetic, or Psychological.
